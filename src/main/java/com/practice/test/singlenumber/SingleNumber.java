//263. Ugly Number
/*An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

Start with the number 8.
Check if it's less than or equal to 0. It's not, so continue.
Check divisibility by 2. 8 is divisible by 2, so divide 8 by 2, which gives 4.
Now, check if 4 is divisible by 2 again. It is, so divide 4 by 2, which gives 2.
Now, check if 2 is divisible by 2 again. It is, so divide 2 by 2, which gives 1.
Check if 1 is equal to 1. It is, so return true.
